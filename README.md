## Triangle Tracker

##### Authored by Michael Kipchumba



### About Project

Triangle Tracker is a web app that seeks to tell the type of triangle based on the length of the dimensions that a user enters. It tests for three types of triangles, equilateral, isosceles or scalene, based on length of its sides.

*A result of the user's entry is displayed on the side.*

#### Project Approach

The aim of the project came down to the following:

- Take 3 values from the user and test them against set conditions then return the result.
- The values taken would have to be numerical and positive.
- The results should be displayed to the user.
- There would have option to reset the input fields to allow the user to enter new data, if they want to.

The web app manages to achieve most of this. Below is a flowchart that summarizes how the app works:
